    "There are two things that we observe in this example.  First and most obvious is that the entries are all displayed in scientific notation.  The more disturbing observation is that the result is not exactly what we wanted.  The elimination process is supposed to produce zeros for all the entries below the main diagonal, but in this case there is one entry that is not $\\texttt{0.000}$.  Instead it is an extremely small number, close to $10^{-17}$.  At this point we might question the code and start looking for errors, but the problem here does not lie with the code.  The issue here is something deeper, and involves the precision limitations of the computer.  When the computer carries out the operations of arithmetic it does not always work with exact numbers.  In most cases the results get rounded off to a number that the machine can represent.  This limitation is known as **roundoff error** and it is the reason we do not get exactly zero for all of the entries below the diagonal.  \n",
