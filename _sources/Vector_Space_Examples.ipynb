If we take two elements from $\\mathbb{P}_3$, $p = 2x^3 - x^2 + 6x -8$ and $q = x^3 - 3x^2 -4x -3$ for example, the linear combination $p+2q = 4x^3 - 7x^2 -2x -14$ is well-defined, and is another element in $\\mathbb{P}_3$.

    "In [Matrix Algebra](Matrix_Algebra.ipynb), we pointed out that the matrices with only one column are commonly referred to as vectors, and that the algebra of matrices does not need to be defined in any special way to work on those with a single column.  The algebraic machinery required to compute linear combinations of matrices in general is no different than that required to compute linear combinations of those with a single column.  Perhaps it is then natural to think that matrices with multiple columns are as much a vector as those with a single column.  In one sense the single column matrix, which we have been calling a vector, is just a special type of matrix.  Based on the formal definition of a vector space however, the collection of all matrices of a given shape constitute a vector space, since the operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication satisfy all the algebraic requirements.  In this sense *the matrices are vectors* since they are objects that make up a vector space.  No doubt this langauge is confusing.   \n",
