    "As we have seen, it is sometimes necessary to rearrange the rows of a matrix when performing elimination.  This row operation can also be done by multiplying the matrix with an elementary matrix.  Let's build a matrix $P$ that performs an exchange of rows 2 and 3 in a $4\\times 4$ matrix.  Again, we can do this by performing the same row operation on the identity matrix.  "
