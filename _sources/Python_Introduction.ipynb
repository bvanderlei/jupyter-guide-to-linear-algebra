    "Note that when we use the square root function, we need to use the call $\\texttt{math.sqrt}$ instead of just $\\texttt{sqrt}$.  This is because the square root function is actually a part of the $\\texttt{math}$ module, and is not in the basic set of Python commands.  The use of this dot notation is ubiquitous in Python.  Whenever $\\texttt{object2}$ is contained within $\\texttt{object1}$, we access $\\texttt{object2}$ by using $\\texttt{object1.object2}$.\n",

We will import it in later sections when we want to make use of functions that we create in the earlier sections.  Note that unlike the $\\texttt{math}$ module, the $\\texttt{laguide}$ module is not in the Python standard library.  This means that in order to use $\\texttt{laguide}$ outside of the Jupyter Guide to Linear Algebra, the source code must be copied from the repository [github.com/bvanderlei/jupyter-guide-to-linear-algebra](https://github.com/bvanderlei/jupyter-guide-to-linear-algebra) before it can be imported.
