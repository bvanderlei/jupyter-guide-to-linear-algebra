    "Numpy is an essential Python package for carrying out the calculations needed for linear algebra as well as other areas of scientific computing.  Matplotlib is a extensive Python package for producing a wide variety of plots.  In this section we will demonstrate a few of the basic elements of these packages that will be used repeatedly throughout the Jupyter Guide to Linear Algebra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that NumPy is used for many of the actual calculations encounted in linear algebra, while we use Matplotlib only to make useful visual representations of the concepts.  The use of NumPy therefore will be crucial, while the use of Matplotlib is not explicitly required to engage with the content of the guide.  The Matplotlib demonstration below also contains more complex details that might be difficult to digest until the reader gains some experience with Python.  For these reasons, The reader may choose to skip the introduction to Matplotlib and return at a later point if interest arises. \n",

NumPy has a convenient way to represent arrays and has many built-in tools for processing them.  Let's dive right in and create some arrays.  Just as with the math module, we have to first import NumPy before we can use it.  This time we will use the code $\\texttt{import numpy as np}$, which imports the module but gives it a different name that is a little more convenient to type. \n",
