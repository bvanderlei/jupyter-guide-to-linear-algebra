    "A key connection between linear transformations and matrix algebra is the fact that every linear transformation can be carried out by matrix multiplication.  It is natural then to associate the matrix with the linear transformation in some way.  Conversely, when carrying out matrix multiplication, it is quite natural to consider the associated linear transformation that it represents.  In this way, matrix multiplication can be viewed as a means of mapping vectors in one space to vectors in another. "

Suppose the transformation $T:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ has the standard matrix representation $[T]$, and we want to know if there exists an inverse transformation $T^{-1}:\\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.  We need to know if the linear system $[T]X = B$ has a unique soluition for every $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\n",

The only way that this is possible is if the matrix $[T]$ has a *row with no pivot*, since there can be no more than one pivot per row.  We also found that $[T]X=B$ will have a unique solution when there is a pivot in each column of $[T]$.  Thus $[T]X=B$ will have a unique solution for every $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ exactly when the matrix $[T]$ has a pivot in each row and in each column.  In this case the linear transformation $T$ will be invertible, and the matrix $[T]$ will have an inverse.\n",
