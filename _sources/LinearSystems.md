Linear Systems
=======================


In this first chapter, we examine linear systems of equations and seek a method for their solution.  We also introduce
the machinery of matrix algebra which will be necessary in later chapters.

Example.


Demonstrate the three possible solution sets for a 2d system, showing the pictures associated with each.

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_1 + 3x_2 & = & 5 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 & = & -5 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
