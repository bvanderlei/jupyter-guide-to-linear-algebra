For example, the number $1/3$, which has a decimal representation that consists of an infinite string of $3$s, cannot be represented *exactly* using a finite decimal representation.  This means that the arrays representing the system may be slightly incorrect even before any calculations are performed.  As the computer carries out the operations of arithmetic, the results must be rounded off to numbers that can be represented exactly.
