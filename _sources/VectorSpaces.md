Vector Spaces
=======================

This Chapter looks at several ideas concerning vector space.  Although it is possible to think about a vector space in a very abstract way, we will focus on just two or three concrete examples.


Objectives:

1. Determine when a linear system has a solution.
2. Determine when the solution to a linear system is unique.
3. Identify vector subspaces.
4. Determine if a given vector lies in a given subspace.

Sections:

1. General system AX = B for non-square A. 
2. Linear combinations, spans, and connection to existence of solutions of AX=B.
3. Linear independence and connection to AX=B through AX=0.
4. Subspaces, Bases and coordinates?
5. General vector spaces and subspaces.
6. Nullspace and Column space.

Define **vector space** here and give example of $R^n$.  Give other examples of vector spaces near the end of the chapter.
This would allow us to discuss the existence of solutions in the section on spans by checking whether the columns of $A$ span
$R^m$.
