If $A$, $B$, and $X$ were instead only numbers, we would recognize immediately that the way to solve for $X$ is to divide both sides of the equation by $A$, so long as $A\\neq 0$.  The natural question to ask about the system is 'Can we define matrix division?'\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is 'Not quite.'  We can make progress though by understanding that in the case that $A$,$B$, and $X$ are numbers, we could also find the solution by multiplying by $1/A$.  This subtle distinction is important because it means that we do not need to define division.  We only need to find the number, that when muliplied by $A$ gives 1.  This number is called the multiplicative inverse of $A$ and is written as $1/A$, so long as $A\\neq 0$.\n",

In order to solve the system $AX=B$, we want to multiply by a certain matrix, that when multiplied by $A$ will give the identity matrix $I$.

We have to solve $n$ systems to just to find the inverse of an $n \\times n$ matrix, so it appears that it takes $n$ times the amount of work that it would to just solve the system by elimination.  Suppose however that we needed to solve a linear system $AX=B$ for *many different vectors* $B$, but the same coefficient matrix $A$.
