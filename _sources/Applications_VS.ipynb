The examples discussed in this section involve molecules, which are made up of atoms, and text documents, which are made up of words.  In some cases equations involving the objects give rise to vector equations.  In other instances there are reasons to perform operations on the vectors using matrix algebra.  "

Algorithms which aim to search the database for documents that are most relevant to keyword searches can then make use of the vector representation.  We provide some simple examples of how such algorithms might work.\n",

This list could be a list of each distinct word in the whole collection of documents, but there are many common words in English that we might disqualify as keywords since they appear abundantly in all documents (the, as, in, it, etc.).  Each document in the database can now be represented by a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, with the $n$th entry set to 1 if the corresponding keyword appears in the document, and 0 otherwise.\n",

For example, *Search Engine Algorithms* would be represented as $[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]$.  Our database then is represented by a $n\\times 10$ matrix that has a row for each title.

The search is executed by a single matrix multiplication, followed by a search of the resulting vector for the largest entry.
